echo "Kicking gpg-agent"

# From GPG-AGENT(1):
#   The agent is automatically started on demand by gpg, gpgsm, gpgconf, or
#   gpg-connect-agent.  Thus there is no reason to start it manually. In case
#   you want to use the included  Secure  Shell  Agent  you  may start the
#   agent using:
gpg-connect-agent /bye
